# Driver-Safety-System
This system ensures the safety of the drivers by preventing accidents with the help of state of the mouth and eyes of the driver.
In recent years driver fatigue is one of the major causes of vehicle accidents in the world. A direct way of measuring driver fatigue is measuring the state of the driver i.e., drowsiness. 
So, it is very important to detect the drowsiness of the driver to save life and property. This project is aimed towards developing a prototype of drowsiness detection system. 
This system is a real time system which captures image continuously and measures the state of the eye, mouth according to the specified algorithm and gives warning if required.
This approach is completely non-intrusive which does not affect the driver in any way, hence giving the exact condition of the driver.
For detection of drowsiness the per closure value of eye is considered. So, when the closure of eye exceeds a certain amount then the driver is identified to be sleepy. 
When the mouth of the driver is opened more than a specific diameter, the system considers that the driver is yawning.
Robustness to factors like occlusions (e.g., wearing glasses) and head movements are also considered.
